# Some key features of this project:
    1. Created with React Js.
    2. Used React Router for Single Page Application.
    3. If Answer is correct, a toast will be prompted saying "Correct Answer" and if it is wrong, a toast will be prompted saying "Wrong answer".
    4. Correct Answer count is shown on a sidebar component through the whole quiz webpage and in mobile devices, the sidebar will be transparent for a better user friendly view. 
    5. In Quiz section, each question can be answered once. Multiple attempts are not allowed. There will be a Toast error message mentioning the attemps. So there is no chance to icrease the Correct Answer Count by just answering the same question multiple.
    6.Used ChartJS to display the BarChart of Quiz Topics.
    7. Fully Responsive Web design.
    8. Used Mamba UI and KitWind UI of Tailwind CSS.
